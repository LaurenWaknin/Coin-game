Hello Lauren This is your Hackaton Feedback.
I enjoyed your project was fun to jump, collect and avoid to died. I liked that the game restarted when your
fall that was a nice feature. I understand you need more time to keep working in a game that involves a lot
of complexity to develop but the first impression of it is a very good job.

Good utilizations of functions, object and arrays methods all over the code. 

Good job and congratulations.
